HIVE:

-->Data Warehouse is the place where all types of databases and files are stored.
-->Hive stores metadata of the table like table structure,location etc in its local database known as derby Metastore.
-->Hive stores Data in Hadoop and is a SQL Server built on top of Hadoop.
-->Hive queries data from the HDFS Tables.
-->A table is nothing but a HDFS Directory with files.
-->A table's structure and location are to be specified when creating the table in hive.
-->Only Cloudera provides a web interface called Hue to the users.
-->Command line interfaces of Hive are Beeline and JDBC/ODBC Servers
-->Hive can do cross platform operations/application developement using thrift servers like
-->Hive's driver compiles,optimizes and executes operations.
-->Hive does not include write/update operation and can only perform read operations.
-->When you load data from hadoop into hive,hive extracts the data and stores the files/data into another new 
   location within the hadoop system in a different director or location which will be different from the original 
   location of the files/data and the new location will depend on Hive's internal structure and settings.
   This happens only for the Hive's Internal Tables.The Internal Tables are called Managed Tables.
-->To solve this problem we can create and use a Hive External Table.
-->There are two types of partition in Hive namely Static and Dynamic.
-->Output of Map Reduce is Parquet File.
-->Instead of manually defining each partition in a table, dynamic partitioning allows the system to automatically
   create partitions based on the distinct values in a specified column. This can significantly reduce the 
   administrative overhead of managing partition metadata.
-->Dynamic partitioning can greatly enhance query performance.
